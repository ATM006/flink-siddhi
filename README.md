============

> A light-weight library to run siddhi cep within flink streaming application.

__Version:`1.2-SNAPSHOT`__

## About

Siddhi CEP is a lightweight and easy-to-use Open Source Complex Event Processing Engine (CEP) released as a Java Library under `Apache Software License v2.0`. 
Siddhi CEP processes events which are generated by various event sources, analyses them and notifies appropriate complex events according to the user specified queries. 

This project is mainly to provide a light-weight library to easily run Siddhi CEP within flink streaming application.
    
## How to Use

* Add `flink-siddhi` in maven dependency:

	<dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.haoch</groupId>
        <artifactId>flink-siddhi</artifactId>
        <version>1.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
 
* Start using API from `SiddhiCEP`, for example:

     StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
     SiddhiCEP cep = SiddhiCEP.getSiddhiEnvironment(env);
    
     cep.registerExtension("custom:plus",CustomPlusFunctionExtension.class);
    
     cep.registerStream("inputStream1", input1, "id", "name", "price","timestamp");
     cep.registerStream("inputStream2", input2, "id", "name", "price","timestamp");
    
     DataStream<Tuple5<Integer,String,Integer,String,Double>> output = cep
     	.from("inputStream1").union("inputStream2")
     	.sql(
    		"from every s1 = inputStream1[id == 2] "
    		 + " -> s2 = inputStream2[id == 3] "
    		 + "select s1.id as id_1, s1.name as name_1, s2.id as id_2, s2.name as name_2 , custom:plus(s1.price,s2.price) as price"
    		 + "insert into outputStream"
    	)
    	.returns("outputStream");
    
     env.execute();

## How to Test

   mvn clean test

## Main Features

* Integrate Siddhi CEP as an stream operator (i.e. `TupleStreamSiddhiOperator`), supporting rich CEP features like
  * Filter
  * Join
  * Aggregation
  * Group by
  * Having
  * Window
  * Conditions and Expressions
  * Pattern processing
  * Sequence processing
  * Event Tables
  * ...
  
* Provide easy-to-use Siddhi CEP API to integrate Flink DataStream API (See `SiddhiCEP` and `SiddhiStream`)
  * Register Flink DataStream associating native type information with Siddhi Stream Schema, supporting POJO,Tuple, Primitive Type, etc.
  * Connect with single or multiple Flink DataStreams with Siddhi CEP Execution Plan
  * Return output stream as DataStream with type intelligently inferred from Siddhi Stream Schema
  
* Integrate siddhi runtime state management with Flink state (See `AbstractSiddhiOperator`)

* Support siddhi plugin management to extend CEP functions. (See `SiddhiCEP#registerExtension`)
